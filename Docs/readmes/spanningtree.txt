Program for testing STP includes modes to test through:
Normal:

	Generic testing just for some BPDU packets existance. Shows all tree roots currently active for the node you are. 

	#
	# Add rx-tcn
	# Add tx-bpdu
	#


Two switches: NOW ON DEVELOPEMENT

	Testing which trace changes when one of the switches become new root.

	#
	# Add rootguard
	# Add colibration of priority with changing prio and cost
	#

	1. Set some setting on both switches the way one of them will be the root. // This part is going via telnet, partly need admin's attention.

	2. Collect packets from the sources. Remembers current state of the system.

	3. Changes switches symmetrically.

	4. Collect packets and compare saved and new states.

Guard: NOW EVEN NOT ON DEVELOPEMENT

	This mode is thought to test bpdu-guard feature on switch's ports.

	#
	# Add something with bpdu filter and guard
	#

	1. Setting up the interfaces on the switch.

	1.2. Remembering the state.

	2. Spamming bpdus.

	3. Comparing current state with saved.

--------------
In future add things with path costs.
